# First one was to write an algorithm that traverses a tree of digits starting 
# at the root and calculates the sum of the numbers that are formed by each path. For example if the tree was:
#        5
#       / \
#      4   2
#     / \
#   1   3
#the algorithm should calculate 541 + 543 + 52.







# Write an algorithm that would take an array representing a number, 
# and find the largest number that can be created by swapping only two 
# digits. For example if the input was [1,2,3,4,5]  the algorithm should 
# swap the 1 and the 5 and output [5,2,3,4,1].
